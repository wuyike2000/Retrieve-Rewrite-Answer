# Retrieve-Rewrite-Answer: A KG-to-Text Enhanced LLMs Framework for Knowledge Graph Question Answering

> **Abstract**
Despite their competitive performance on knowledge-intensive tasks, large language models (LLMs) still have limitations in memorizing all world knowledge especially long tail knowledge. In this paper, we study the KG-augmented language model approach for solving the knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) task that requires rich world knowledge. Existing work has shown that retrieving KG knowledge to enhance LLMs prompting can significantly improve LLMs performance in KGQA. However, their approaches lack a well-formed verbalization of KG knowledge, i.e., they ignore the gap between KG representations and textual representations. To this end, we propose an answer-sensitive KG-to-Text approach that can transform KG knowledge into well-textualized statements most informative for KGQA. Based on this approach, we propose a KG-to-Text enhanced LLMs framework for solving the KGQA task. Experiments on several KGQA benchmarks show that the proposed KG-to-Text augmented LLMs approach outperforms previous KG-augmented LLMs approaches regarding answer accuracy and usefulness of knowledge statements.

## Usage
### Corpus Generation
We provide our generated KG-to-Text corpus in ```corpus_generation/MetaQA/KG-to-Text/data```, ```corpus_generation/WQSP/KG-to-Text/data``` and ```corpus_generation/ZJQA/KG-to-Text/data```. We also provide these corpus in Stanford Alpaca format for direct finetuning in ```finetune-llama/MetaQA```, ```finetune-llama/WQSP```, ```finetune-llama/ZJQA```, ```finetune-t5/data```.  
If you want to generate your KG-to-Text corpus, please follow these steps and be ready to spend a lot of money ;)  
1. Run the files in ```process``` sequentially as described in ```Package Description``` to process the QA data  
For WQSP, you need to build freebase in virtuoso to support entity names query. You can directly use our provided processed data to skip this step.  
2. Run the files in ```KG-to-Text``` sequentially as described in ```Package Description``` to generate the KG-to-Text corpus and transform it into Stanford Alpaca format  

### LLM finetuning
#### Llama finetuning
Run the correct shell for finetuning Llama in ```finetune-llama```.  
Please note you should choose different shells for finetuning different size and language Llama. You may need to modify some parameters (e.g. pretrained_model, batch_size).
#### Flan-T5 finetuning
Run ```train.py``` in ```finetune-t5```.  
You may need to modify some parameters (e.g. model_path, batch_size).

### KGQA
#### Retrieve
Run the files in ```retrieve``` sequentially as described in ```Package Description``` to retrieve subgraph  
For WQSP, you need to build freebase in virtuoso to support entity names query. You can directly use our provided retrieved result to skip this step.
#### Rewrite
Run ```infer_llama.py```, ```infer_t5-xl.py``` and ```infer_mvp.py``` in ```rewrite``` to transform triple-form text into free-form text based on different LLMs.  
You may need to modify the path for the model or output file.
#### Answer
Run the files in ```answer``` to answer the questions. For detailed usage, please refer to ```Package Description```. You may need to modify the path for the model, input file or output file.
